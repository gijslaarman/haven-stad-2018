# Haven-Stad 2018 wrapped
A project for the municipality of Amsterdam, visual report of 2018.

For the municipality of Amsterdam I created a report together with [@sterrevangeest](https://github.com/sterrevangeest) & [Joline](https://www.behance.net/joline-baas) a summary of the year 2018 for Amsterdam. 
It would serve as a throwback for later to see what events were playing and why certain decisions were made that year. It's presented in a playful way so it's also nice to read/interact with for all residents of Amsterdam.
